# Introduction to best coding practices

When you employ good coding practices, your code will be easier to maintain, and hence the likelihood of introducing code defects will be reduced. Many bugs tend to slip in when new features are introduced, or when problems are being fixed.

It is much easier to spot anomalies in code that follows the appropriate conventions, than it is in code that doesn't. Reading through code requires much less brain power when it is familiar than when one has to figure out the semantics of many code fragments.

In this section, you'll read about the importance of code style, proper formatting, using appropriate idioms, essentially all conventions that will help to interpret code correctly and efficiently. We will discuss general principles, best practices and tips that help you to write clean code in any programming language.
