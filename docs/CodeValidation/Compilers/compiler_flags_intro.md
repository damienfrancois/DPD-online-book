# Introduction to compiler flags

You would not be the first to be intimidated while browsing the documentation of a modern compiler. The number of command line flags and options easily runs into the hundreds.

You can use many of these options to tune the compilation process to improve the performance of your code, but quite a number are available to generate errors and warnings whenever the compiler has misgivings about your code.

In this section we will discuss compiler options that will help you find code defects. We will also illustrate that if you ignore compiler warnings, you do so at your own peril.

"All compilers are equal, but some are more equal than others." We will also give some examples of the advantage of using multiple compilers, since each has its strengths and its weaknesses when it comes to warning about potential bugs in your code.

As general advise, you should not be satisfied unless your code compiles without a warning with any compiler you can get your hands on.
