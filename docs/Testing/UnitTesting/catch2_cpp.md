# Catch2: unit testing for C++

Although you could use CUnit for testing C++ code, there are better alternatives.  A very nice framework is [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).  You can express tests quite naturally using Catch2 so that they resemble a narrative.

The framework takes a further step along that path by offering support for [Behaviour Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (BDD).
